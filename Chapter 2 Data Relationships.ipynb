In the study, the researchers measured the amount of calcium retained by the body as a response variable and the amount consumed as an explanatory variable.  The results are plotted below, with a curve fitted to the data for children aged 11 to 15 years.  You can clearly see there is a relationship, however it is not linear across the range of values.
